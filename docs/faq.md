# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about LeanProxy-MCP.

## General

### What is LeanProxy-MCP?

LeanProxy-MCP is a lightweight CLI proxy that sits between your IDE and MCP servers. It acts as a "Token Firewall" - reducing token consumption and redacting sensitive data (API keys, secrets, PII) before it reaches LLM providers.

### Why do I need LeanProxy-MCP?

1. **Security**: Automatically redacts secrets, API keys, and PII from prompts
2. **Cost Optimization**: Reduces token usage by removing boilerplate and sensitive data
3. **Centralized Management**: Manage all MCP servers from one configuration
4. **Shadow Manifesting**: Automatically merges global and project MCP configurations

### What IDEs support LeanProxy-MCP?

- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- OpenCode
- Windsurf
- Any IDE with MCP support

### What languages/frameworks does it support?

LeanProxy-MCP is language-agnostic. It works with any MCP server regardless of the implementation language.

```

Or via config:

```yaml

### Can I add custom redaction patterns?

Yes! Add to your config:

```yaml
bouncer:
  patterns:
    - name: "my-secret"
      type: "regex"
      pattern: "MY_SECRET=[A-Za-z0-9]+"
      replacement: "MY_SECRET=REDACTED"
```

### What built-in patterns are available?

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found" error

Make sure LeanProxy is in your PATH:

```bash
# Verify installation
leanproxy-mcp version

# If not found, check installation
which leanproxy-mcp
# or
where leanproxy-mcp
```

### Server won't start

1. Check if port is available:
```bash
lsof -i :8080
```

2. Check logs:
```bash
leanproxy-mcp serve --verbose
```

### IDE cannot connect

1. Verify server is running:
```bash
leanproxy-mcp status
```

2. Check IDE configuration matches the server format

### Redaction not working

1. Verify bouncer is enabled:
```bash
leanproxy-mcp bouncer list-patterns
```

2. Check config file is being loaded

## Security

### Is my data sent anywhere?

No. LeanProxy-MCP runs entirely locally. Your data never leaves your machine except to the MCP server you're proxying to.

### Where is data stored?

- Config: `~/.config/leanproxy/`
- Cache: `~/.cache/leanproxy/`
- Logs: stdout or configured log file

### Are my secrets safe?

Yes. The redaction engine runs locally and secrets are never logged or sent anywhere except when explicitly allowed.
